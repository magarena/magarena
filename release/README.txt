- New optional feature that plays animation when AI plays a card from its
  hand. Lets you preview card before it is placed on table. This is
  experimental so defaults to OFF. Activate via new preferences setting.

- Card explorer now displays missing/unimplemented cards. New preferences
  setting can be used to prevent loading extra data for missing cards if it
  takes too long.

- New "Sets" filter and "New Cards" filter which displays the cards whose images were most recently downloaded

- Various look and feel adjustments to the import and preferences dialogs

- complete UI revamp to present a simpler, more focused game-like UI. New look
  should improve touch-screen access.
  * Menubar removed and replaced with "menu" screens accessed using ESC or standard screen icon
  * F12 toggles UI visibility for those want to view the background art in all its glory
  * ESC is global key for displaying options/pause menu
  * ESC can now be used to cancel preferences dialog.
  * Backspace and Delete keys as undo action in duel screen in place of ESC

- added additional ability icons

- updated readme with latest keyboard controls.

- moved duel.txt and duel.cfg into new "duels" directory with a view to
  allowing multiple duels to be saved in future.

- relocated preconstructed dec files from "Magarena/decks" directory to new
  "Magarena/decks/prebuilt" directory. Magarena will prevent user saving new
  decks to or overwriting existing decks in the "prebuilt" directory. "decks"
  directory is still the default for saving user custom decks.

- added new "Deck Editor/Explorer" preference setting that if set will only
  refresh card preview image when actual table entry is selected instead of
  when mouse cursor moves over it. Default is false so behaviour will remain
  the same as before.

- added new setting to show/hide game log messages by default. During a game
  you can toggle visibility by clicking on the log header.

- added the following to the card script:
  * effect: <chosen> discards <amount> cards.
  * effect: <chosen> discards <amount> cards at random.
  * effect: <chosen> draws <amount> cards, then discards <amount> cards.
  * effect: <chosen> gains <amount> life.
  * effect: prevent the next <amount> damage that would be dealt to SN this turn.
  * cost: Sacrifice an Elemental
  * cost: Sacrifice a Wall
  * cost: Sacrifice a permanent
  * cost: Return SN to its owner's hand
  * cost: Pay 3 Life
  * cost: {C2} - remove two charge counters
  * activation restriction: {Sorcery} - activate only as Sorcery
  * ability: protection from legendary creatures
  * property: set_pt=<n>/<m> (for enchantments)

- fixed the following bugs:
  * sort by toughness actually sorts by power in deck builder (issue 398)
  * deck statistics not updated when loading an existing deck in deck editor (issue 430)
  * options icon hit area was extending the full length of the title bar
  * open logs folder' option launches another instance of Magarena (issue 454)
  * deck editor can only save changes to a deck once (issue 432)
  * temporarily disabled Ability Mono deck generator as it causes a runtime exception (issue 446)
  * deck editor/card explorer - mana cost filter does not show all possible costs (issue 440)
  * card explorer - card pool table totals titlebar is missing (issue 439).
  * deck description in duel setup not updated when loading new deck from deck editor (issue 450)
  * unable to close Deck Editor if deck is invalid (issue 431)
  * correct definition of target filter NEG_TARGET_CREATURE_PLUSONE_COUNTER
  * Kodama of the South Tree should affect each other creature you control not each other creature
  * Advance Scout's ability cost should be {W} instead of {1}{W}
